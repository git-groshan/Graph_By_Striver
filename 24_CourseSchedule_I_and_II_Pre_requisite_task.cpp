There are a total of N tasks, labeled from 0 to N-1. Some tasks may have prerequisites, for example to do task 0 you have to first complete task 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
Given the total number of tasks N and a list of prerequisite pairs P, find if it is possible to finish all tasks.


Example 1:

Input: 
N = 4, P = 3
prerequisites = {{1,0},{2,1},{3,2}}
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
To do task 1 you should have completed
task 0, and to do task 2 you should 
have finished task 1, and to do task 3 you 
should have finished task 2. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, P = 2
prerequisites = {{1,0},{0,1}}
Output:
No
Explanation:
To do task 1 you should have completed
task 0, and to do task 0 you should
have finished task 1. So it is impossible.

Your task:
You don’t need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPossible() which takes the integer N denoting the number of tasks, P denoting the number of prerequisite pairs and prerequisite as input parameters and returns true if it is possible to finish all tasks otherwise returns false. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(N + P)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N + P)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
1 ≤ P ≤ 105
