/**
 * Graphs have nodes or  vertex and edges 
 * Graphs are of 2 types 
 * 1. Unidrected Graphs - All edges ar ebidirectional
 * 2. Directed Graphs - All the edges are directed
 * 
 * Cycles in a Graphs - starting from one end and end at the same node.
 * Acyclic graphs - Graph which don't have any cycle associated to it.
 * Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
 * path - contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable
 * A node can not appear twice in path.
 * 
 * Degress in Graphs - No of incoming/outgoing edges to a particular node 
 * Indegree - No of incoming edges to a node
 * Outdegree - No of Outgoing edges to a node
 * for an undirected graph the no of degree is the no of nodes attached to it.
 * Property - total degree of graphs if twice the no of edges 
 * 
 * Directed Graph - has Indegree and outdegree 
 * 
 * Edge weights - edges having weights associated with it.
 * If weights are not assigned then we consider unit weight .
